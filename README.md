I'm making something that you can self host 𝘢𝘯𝘺𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦

Pretty much a toolkit of everything I'd need for the rest of my life.

It must support Windows and Linux.

Perhaps android for a few features

Storage/File Abilities
- Upload and download files
- Share files with dedicated links
- Sync files between devices (using git)
- Backup important files quickly (using git)
- Have a central drive that all your devices can access

KVM Abilities
- Share specific window to other device on network
- Remote Desktop solution
- Share audio between devices
- Switch between devices on network under a single screen/keyboard/mouse setup
- Share clipboard between devices
- Move mouse across devices (Like PowerToys, but cross platform)

Networking Abilities
- Tunnel a port to a custom domain
- Share terminal to other device

So far, the following is implemented
- Tunnel tcp or udp to another port or domain
